2. Phases: Divided into small iterations or sprints, with each iteration delivering a working product.
3. Flexibility: Highly flexible; changes can be made easily throughout development.
4. Collaboration: Emphasizes collaboration and customer feedback.
Scenarios:
1. Waterfall: Preferred for projects with well-defined requirements and low risk of requirement changes, such as government or construction projects.
2. Agile: Preferred for projects with uncertain or evolving requirements, such as software startups or projects requiring rapid delivery and frequent updates.

Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Answer:
Requirements Engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and maintaining the requirements for a software system. It involves understanding what the stakeholders need from the system and ensuring those needs are met.
Process:
1. Elicitation: Gathering requirements from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and observation.
2. Analysis: Analyzing the gathered requirements to resolve conflicts and ambiguities.
3. Specification: Documenting the requirements in a clear and precise manner.
4. Validation: Ensuring the requirements are complete, consistent, and feasible.
5. Management: Managing changes to the requirements as the project progresses.
Importance:
a. Ensures that the final software meets the needs of the users.
b. Helps in identifying potential issues early in the development process.
c. Facilitates better planning and estimation of resources.
d. Reduces the risk of project failure due to misunderstood requirements.

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity is a design principle that involves dividing a software system into distinct, independent modules that can be developed, tested and maintained separately. Each module encapsulates a specific functionality and has well-defined interfaces for communication with other modules.
Benefits:
1. Maintainability: Easier to locate and fix bugs in a modular system because changes in one module do not impact others.
2. Scalability: Modules can be developed and scaled independently, allowing for easier updates and expansion.
3. Reusability: Modules can be reused across different projects, saving time and resources.
4. Collaboration: Multiple teams can work on different modules simultaneously, improving productivity.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?
1. Unit Testing: Tests individual components or functions of the software in isolation to ensure they work correctly.
2. Integration Testing: Tests the interactions between integrated components or systems to identify interface defects.
3. System Testing: Tests the entire system as a whole to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
4. Acceptance Testing: Conducted by the end-users to ensure the software meets their needs and requirements before going live.
Why is testing crucial in software development?
1. Ensures the software functions correctly and meets requirements.
2. Identifies and fixes bugs early in the development process.
3. Enhances the reliability and performance of the software.
4. Increases user satisfaction by delivering a high-quality product.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version Control Systems (VCS) are tools that help manage changes to source code over time. They allow multiple developers to work on a project simultaneously, track changes, and revert to previous versions if needed.
ItsiImportance
1. Collaboration: Enables multiple developers to work on the same project without conflicts.
2. History: Maintains a history of changes, making it easier to track and understand the evolution of the code.
3. Backup: Provides a backup of the codebase, reducing the risk of data loss.
4. Branching and Merging: Facilitates experimentation with new features without affecting the main codebase.
Examples:
1. Git: Distributed VCS, popular for its branching and merging capabilities.
